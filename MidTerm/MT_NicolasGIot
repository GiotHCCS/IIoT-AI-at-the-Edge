1. System Design and Vulnerability Identification
   System Overview:
Hypothetical System: AI-powered, interconnected healthcare monitoring network across three hospital campuses.

   Core Components:
Devices/Sensors: Wearables (heart rate, oxygen monitors), smart infusion pumps, environmental sensors (room temp, oxygen levels)
AI Models: Patient deterioration prediction, anomaly detection in medication dosages
Network Infrastructure: VLANs per department, SD-WAN interlinking hospitals, cloud-hosted EMR (Electronic Medical Records)
Data Flow:
Sensors → Edge Gateway → Local Hospital Server → Cloud Database
AI processing at both edge and centralized cloud levels
Shared Resources: All hospitals access a centralized EMR + AI analytics system; share backup storage and update pipelines

   Vulnerability assessment 
  Component                        Vulnerability                            Exploitation Method
IoT Wearables                    Weak firmware, no encryption	            Packet sniffing, spoofing

Smart Infusion Pumps             Unpatched OS, hardcoded credentials	    Remote code execution

AI Models                        Data poisoning, adversarial attacks	    Injected malformed inputs

Network Infrastructure           Lateral movement between hospital VLANs	Privilege escalation

EMR System                       Shared access, weak role-based control	  Unauthorized data access         

Cloud Storage                    Misconfigured buckets, API key leaks	    Credential stuffing              

Human Factors                    Phishing, tailgating	                    Credential theft, physical access

Inter-hospital Sync              No endpoint validation	                  Man-in-the-middle attacks

This project gave me a clearer understanding of how AI-integrated IIoT systems operate in real healthcare environments, especially with shared EMR systems and 
centralized AI analytics across multiple hospital locations. I learned about network variations like VLANs and SD-WANs and how they support secure, segmented 
communication. Identifying vulnerabilities and simulating attacks showed the importance of layered security and exposed gaps like weak access control and 
outdated certificates. Overall, it deepened my knowledge of IIoT security and practical defense strategies in complex, real-world systems.
